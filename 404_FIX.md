# 404 Error Page Fix

## Problem
Users were encountering Vercel's default 404 error page when clicking on broken links or accessing non-existent routes. The error showed:
```
Code: NOT_FOUND
ID: cpt1::zn5dv-1765597406044-f225f8f83bc0
```

## Solution
Implemented a custom 404 page with user-friendly navigation and proper Vercel routing configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Custom 404 Page (`src/pages/NotFound.tsx`)
- Created a beautiful, user-friendly 404 page component
- Includes:
  - Large 404 error code display
  - Clear error message
  - Shows the attempted path
  - "Go to Home" button
  - "Go Back" button
  - Quick links section with common navigation options
  - Support contact information

### 2. Updated Routing (`src/App.tsx`)
- Changed the catch-all route from `<Navigate to="/" replace />` to `<NotFound />`
- This ensures users see the custom 404 page instead of being redirected

### 3. Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)
- Added rewrite rules to handle client-side routing
- All routes are now properly handled by the React Router
- Added security headers for better protection

## Features

### User-Friendly Design
- Clean, modern UI matching the application's design system
- Responsive layout that works on all devices
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Helpful navigation options

### Navigation Options
1. **Go to Home** - Takes users back to the main page
2. **Go Back** - Uses browser history
3. **Quick Links** - Direct access to:
   - Browse Elections
   - Sign In page

### Error Information
- Displays the attempted path so users know what they tried to access
- Provides context about what went wrong

## Testing

To test the 404 page:
1. Navigate to any non-existent route (e.g., `/this-does-not-exist`)
2. You should see the custom 404 page instead of Vercel's default error
3. Test all navigation buttons to ensure they work correctly

## Deployment

After deploying to Vercel:
1. The `vercel.json` file will automatically configure routing
2. All routes will be handled by React Router
3. Non-existent routes will show the custom 404 page

## Future Improvements

Consider adding:
- Search functionality on the 404 page
- Recent pages/visited pages list
- Analytics tracking for 404 errors
- Dynamic suggestions based on the attempted path
